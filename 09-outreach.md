Subject: High-school research on hedging math — request for 20 minutes feedback

Hello Prof. [Name],

I’m Nolan Price, a junior at Center Grove HS researching hedging math and tail risk. I wrote a math-first note comparing minimum-variance hedges and VaR/CVaR measures. Would you be open to 20 minutes of feedback? Here’s the repo: <link>.

Thank you,  
Nolan Price

Hello [Name],

I’m Nolan Price, a high-school student doing math research on practical hedging. I can prepare a 1-page analysis showing how a small hedge could reduce worst-case losses for [crop / fuel]. I’d love to share a short summary and get feedback.

Best, Nolan
