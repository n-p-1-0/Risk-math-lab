# 08 — Case studies (templates you can fill for local impact)

## Case A — Individual investor (volatile stock)
- Problem: small investor holds $10k in a volatile stock (A).  
- Math: compute historical daily returns for last year → mean, σ, VaR5%. Compute β vs index and propose minimum-variance hedge (β*).
- Recommendation: short fraction β* of index or buy put (explain tradeoffs: cost vs protection).
- One-page deliverable: show pre/post VaR and CVaR numbers, and maximal drawdown.

## Case B — Agricultural producer (commodity)
- Problem: farmer sells corn later; worried prices will fall.
- Math: present futures contract hedge math (linear hedge using correlation between local cash and futures), compute hedging ratio (similar covariance/var formula).
- Recommendation: exact hedge size (percentage of expected production) and explanation of cost/benefit.

## How to turn a case study into impact
1. Create 1-page summary (PDF) aimed at a farmer or CFO.  
2. Offer a 30-minute walk-through to local stakeholder or extension agent.  
3. Record the outcome and publish as `case_study_X_result.md`.
